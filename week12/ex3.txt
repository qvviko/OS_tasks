If we tweak copy.c buffer we can see that time required to copy changes.
If we increase buffer the time will to copy will decrease and vice versa, by decreasing the buffer size the time to copy will increase.

If we add O_SYNC then our I/O will become synchronous and thus increasing copy time drastically since we need to wait till I/O finishes.
If we tweak buffer size with O_SYNC on we can see that the time will act the same as when O_SYNC was off, though the time it takes
to copy will increase to greater values then before.

When changing the buffer the number of syscalls required to copy a file decrease/increase depending if we increase/decrease buffer
size respectively. Since the syscalls have high cost, decreasing their number will increase our performance (what we have seen
when changing buffer size)

When changing O_SYNC flag we make read/write synchronous therefore after each syscall
we will wait until the information has been written for file, thus drastically increasing execution time (what we have seen)
