Since stdout is line buffered it will flush it's buffer only when it has encountered new line symbol, it is full or program has finished.
When you fork a process, child receives an unflushed stdout buffer from it's parent.
Thus in the second program because of there is a new line symbol the buffer is flushed before fork and it prints hello only once.
In first program there is no new line symbol so the buffer is copied to the child after fork and prints hello twice.
