Remove execute permission from everybody:
chmod -x ./_ex3.txt
Result:
-rw-r--r-- 1 vlad vlad 0 Oct 24 16:01 ./_ex3.txt
Grant all permissions to owner and others (not group):
chmod 747./_ex3.txt
(4 to preserve read permission)
Result:
-rwxr--rwx 1 vlad vlad 0 Oct 24 16:01 ./_ex3.txt

There are 9 bits for permissions: first three for the owner, next three for the group, last three for others
Each can be grouped together thus getting:
o   g   a
000 000 000
We then specify each bit and can get this number. So for example 010 011 100 = 234 etc...
Thus 660 means - 110 110 000. Or user and groups can read and write this file (but not execute) (others can't do anything)
775 - 111 111 101. User and groups can read, write, execute others can only read and execute
777 - 111 111 111. Everyone can read, write execute.
