The program will have increased hit rate if recently used page will be referenced again and again
For example: '1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1' - as we access only one page every time it will miss only at the beginning and then no misses, since it
removes pages that was not used recently.
The hit rate will lower if we access different pages and then again and old one since it will be already removed as not used recently.
Example '1 2 3 4 5 6 1' (if we have 5 pages)
